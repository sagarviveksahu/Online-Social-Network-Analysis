I have collected the followers of 3 Tech CEO: Satya Nadela, ,Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook to form a network. The idea is to see how common followers they have. The Collect.py runs almost ~7-9 mins approx.
to collect the followers of each CEO ( sample size limited to 5000 per player) and tweets of the subset of followers(250)(10 tweets per follower).The number of tweets retrieved
is also limited to avoid rate limitation and longer period of data collection.

Cluster.py runs the Girvan Newman algorithm on the graph created among the common user whom they follow and their friends (to avoid clutter and dense graph). The original graph
created is saved to network.png. It could be noted that they are common friends of all CEOs. The users are clustered, based on whether they are really following

Classify.py - Downloaded the AFINN dataset for the analysis of raw data (tweets) whether the tweets about the users is positive, negative or mixed.
Tokenized the tweets into tokens and score the tokens on the basis of AFINN dataset.
If the tweet contains more score of positive words than negative words then the tweet belongs to the positive class.
If the tweet contains more score of negative words than positive words then the tweet belongs to the negative class.
And if the score of positive and negative words are equal then the tweet belongs to the mixed class.

Summarize.py -Collected the information using the results got from collect.py, cluster.py and classify.py

Conclusion: From the implementation of the Assignment I have learnt that how many people are following the top tech giants. and also
Most of the tweets belong to mixed class or positive class, from which its difficult to say that the tweet is negative or positive.
